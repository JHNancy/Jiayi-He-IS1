	<h2>Answers For Questions (Conversations with Robots: Voice, Smart Agents & the Case for Structured Content)</h2>
<p>1. Structured content is the process of structuring content resources (such as articles, recipes, product descriptions, how-tos, profiles, and so on) into frameworks. These are packages of small pieces of content data that are meaningfully related to each other. 
	Semantic HTML is markup that conveys meaningful information about the relationships between document elements, rather than simply describing how they appear on the screen. 
	The difference between them is structured content is about what the content is and how it is stored, while semantic HTML is about how to meaningfully mark up and express that content in code.</p>
	
<p>2. They are two parts of the same system, and they complement each other. Structured content organizes material into predictable, reusable components, and semantic HTML provides machine-readable markup for structured content.</p>
	
<p>3. Having structured content and semantic HTML on a web page is important because their combination makes the content reusable, more meaningful, and more accessible. Good structure also gives users a better experience.</p>

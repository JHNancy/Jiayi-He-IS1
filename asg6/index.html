	<h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>
<p>Below is my summary and conclusion of the six thinking hats.
	<img src="images/hat (1).png">
    <h2>Each Thinking Hats</h2>
	<h3>White Hat</h3>
<p>My semester project involved information on various soft furnishing styles and furniture styles and brands. If I were to create a compelling soft furnishings website, I'd likely need specific information about the guestâ€™s style, preferences, and preferences. However, since I might not have that specific information, I might instead propose a complete soft furnishings set in the entire house to each style. My initial semester project likely missed some more affordable soft furnishings brands. The question I raised was, "Is this too much information? Should I consider streamlining and focusing on just one or two types of furniture?" I could find more information online or visit furniture stores.</p>
<h3>Red Hat</h3>
<p>I think this semester project is feasible and meaningful because it can provide help and advice to people who need to renovate or buy a new house. Our intuition is that this project will require a lot of work and the results will be very good.</p>

<h3>Black Hat</h3>
<p>The problem is that I might be trying to take care of too many things, which would increase my workload and make the page look too complicated. The potential problem might be how to make the page look harmonious and consistent with my soft furnishing theme.</p>

<h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
<p>This might work because the information on the site is well-founded and aesthetically pleasing, potentially helping people who need interior design ideas, which is the value of this site. I'll do my best to add designs and interior design sets that appeal to the general public to make it more helpful. I think I'll make my pages comfortable to read and add some small animations to make them more appealing.</p>

<h3>Green Hat:</h3> 
<p>Because one of the potential challenges of this semester's project is that everyone's aesthetic tastes vary, I'll do my best to focus on popular soft furnishing styles. I considered creating a wedding planning page as an alternative, but that would have been significant work. Our solution to black hat problem is to focus on a few soft furnishings and then devote more information to them.</p>

<h3>Blue Hat</h3>
<p>The subject of this semester's project was soft furnishings. My main focus was to provide those in need with ideas and advice on choosing soft furnishings. My goal was to provide genuine assistance and design a website that was engaging, comfortable, and innovative. We searched various furniture stores to keep our discussions on track. For each hat, we concluded that the detailed information on the soft furnishing style; feel not bad for this semester project; the abundance of information; helping people who are about to install soft furnishings; thinking about more for my page; thinking about my goals.</p>

<h2>Second Section</h2>
<p>After this discussion, I added more software design information for my semester project. 
	
	I knew what my goals were and which software design areas I should focus on. 
	
	I also eliminated other unnecessary information I wanted to invest in. 
	
	Overall, this discussion was very helpful and helped me lay the base for my page.</p>

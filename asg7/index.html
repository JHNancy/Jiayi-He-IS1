	<h1>The King:Bob</h1>
	<h2>Section 1</h2>
	<h3>Short Bio</h3>
	<p>Bob is a member of the Minions and a very popular character. 
		He has heterochromatic eyes, his left eye is brown and his right eye is green. 
		He always takes his little bear, Tim, with him on his adventures.</p>
	
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>I think he's the perfect fit to be the king of the Minions because Bob is innocent, kind, loyal, optimistic, 
			and full of childlike innocence, as evidenced by the fact that he always carries Tim with him. 
			I believe a leader of a country should possess these qualities. 
			Furthermore, Bob's experience as a king gives him a better understanding of how to rule.

	<h1> My Least Favorite Actor: Yangyang</h1>
	<img src="images/yangyang-resized.jpeg">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>A Chinese actor, singer, and dancer, he graduated from the Dance Department of the PLA Academy of Art in 2003. He has numerous productions and a considerable fan base in China.</p>
	<h2>Why is he my least favorite actor?</h2>
	<p>I won't comment on his appearance, as everyone has a different definition of beauty and ugliness. However, I think his performance in the his series was terrible. 
		His lines and acting were all greasy, unrealistic, and too contrived. Of course, I don't hate this person, I just think his acting and lines need to be improved, and when I watch his performances I feel very distracted and embarrassed.</p>

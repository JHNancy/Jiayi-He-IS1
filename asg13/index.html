    <h1>Three Dream Jobs</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Introduction: I believe the type of work best suited to me is about the arts, where I can utilize my artistic inspiration. I hope to apply my artistic sensibilities to perform at a high level in related work.</p>

	<div id="job1">
    <h2>1: Wedding Photographer</h2>
    <ul>
      <ol><img src="images/logo-onecolor-2.png" class="img1"></ol>
      <ol>Wedding Photographer</ol>
      <ol><a href=https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cf7b4199dd249ade&from=shareddesktop_copy target="_blank" class="link">Link For Apply</a></ol>
      <ol><a href="https://www.thepros.com/" target="_blank">Website For Company</a></ol>
      <ol>Why: I think this job is great for me. First, because I enjoy photography in my free time, whether it's portraits or landscapes. I feel very happy when I can take photos that I'm satisfied with, so this job will give me a lot of fulfillment. I'm also someone who easily appreciates beauty. Therefore, I can capture the unique stories of different people and weddings and reflect them in my photographs.</ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>2: Interior Designer</h2>
    <ul>
      <ol><img src="images/job2.png" class=img2></ol>
      <ol>Interior Designer</ol>
      <ol><a href=https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=44fe6fe2266ab4bc&from=shareddesktop_copy target="_blank" class="link">Link For Apply</a></ol>
      <ol><a href="https://icodallas.com/areas-served/plano-tx/" target="_blank">Website For Company</a></ol>
      <ol>Why: First, I think this job is great because it's highly relevant to my current major, which could potentially help me perform my work better. Second, I also love thinking about the layout of different rooms and the layout of my dream house. I think it's really cool to be able to design a house that truly belongs to me from a professional's perspective. Finally, this job can help people who need to layout their new homes, making the best use of their space and fulfilling their ideas.</ol>
    </ul>  
  </div>

	<div id="job3">
    <h2>3: Model/Actor</h2>
      <ul>
      <ol><img src="images/flow_motion_inc_logo.jpg" class=img3></ol>
      <ol>Actor</ol>
      <ol><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=33284d3f7d6760f1&from=shareddesktop_copy" target="_blank" class="link">Link For Apply</a></ol>
      <ol><a href="https://www.instagram.com/flowmotionmanagement/" target="_blank">Website For Company</a></ol>
      <ol>Why: I think this job is excellent because its hourly wage is relatively high. Although I may have a very small chance of getting involved in this job, I think being an actor is the most charming job. Acting has always been a great job for me, and it has always been my dream career since I was a child. If can become a famous actor, the feeling of being adored by a lot of people is what I yearn for very much.</ol>

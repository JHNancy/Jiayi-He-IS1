	<h1>Dodgeball: Team Marvel  </h1>
    </header>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p class="p">My dodgeball team is called Team Marvel, and I want my team members to be agile, possess exceptional willpower, and endurance. 
	Therefore, I've chosen five members from the Marvel universe who I believe perfectly fit my requirements, and I think they will help my Team Marvel achieve final victory.</p>

	<h3>Captain America</h3>

	<aside class="p1"><p>Captain America, the central character of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is named Steve Rogers. 
		After undergoing super-modification by the US government, his physical abilities became superhuman, earning him the title of "Super Soldier." 
		Following a fierce battle, he was accidentally frozen in the sea for 70 years before being rescued and joining the Avengers under S.H.I.E.L.D. 
		Because of Captain America's exceptional physical abilities, I hope he can join my dodgeball team and become a key member.</p></aside>

	<h3>Black Panther</h3>
	<img src="images/bp1.png" class="bp1">
	<aside class="p2"><p>Black Panther is a superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His real name is T'Challa, and he is the King of Wakanda. Wakanda exists in a third world unseen by ordinary people. 
		He is deeply devoted to his country and vows to protect it and vibranium. When his country is in danger, he transforms into the superhero Black Panther to protect it. 
		I chose him because he has long relied on heart-shaped plants to enhance his physical abilities and combat skills. 
		His abilities and speed are immense, allowing him to dodge quickly in dodgeball.</p></aside>

	<h3>Captain Marvel</h3>
	<img src="images/cma1.webp" class="cma1">
	<aside class="p3"><p>Captain Marvel's real name is Carol Danvers. 
		She is a hero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Originally a U.S. Air Force officer, she absorbed alien energy in an accident, 
		gaining superhuman strength, flight abilities, and the power to unleash bursts of energy. She is said to be a hero on par with Thanos. 
		I chose her as a member of my dodgeball team because of her outstanding abilities.</p></aside>

	<h3>Spider Man</h3>
	<img src="images/sm1.webp" class="sm1">
	<aside class="p4"><p>Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker, a superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
		After being bitten by a radioactive spider, he gained superhuman strength, agility, and the ability to climb walls, 
		and created his own web-shooters to become "Spider-Man." He helps those in need in his community as Spider-Man, and in his private life, 
		he is a high school student. He was also taught the philosophy of "with great power comes great responsibility" by his adoptive father. 
		One of the reasons I chose him as a member of my dodgeball team is because of his incredible agility and ability to dodge incoming balls./p></aside>

	<h3>Black Widow</h3>
	<img src="images/bw1.webp" class="bw1">
	<aside class="p5"><p>Black Widow's real name is Natasha Romanoff, and she is one of the main heroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers. 
		She was originally a Russian spy before joining S.H.I.E.L.D. and becoming a member of the Avengers. 
		Black Widow underwent rigorous training as a child, making her skilled in combat, stealth, and intelligence gathering. 
		Although she doesn't have superpowers, her exceptional fighting skills, intelligence, and courage make her an indispensable member of the team. 
		I chose her for my team because of her unwavering will and agility.</p></aside>

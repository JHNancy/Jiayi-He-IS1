	<h2>Three Domain Name</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>softfurnishings.fit</li>
		<li>softfurnishings.space</li>
		<li>softfurnishings.info</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Part 2</h2>
	<h3>Summary with my classmate</h3>
	<p>My classmates and I have discussed a little about my Domain Name in class, and we have agreed on the feeling I want to give to customers through my semester project. 
		For example, I hope that the space provided by my website can be helpful and suitable for people in need.</p>
	<h3>Why I like them?</h2>
	<p>The reason why I like and choose these three is because I think these three suffixes are very suitable for the theme of my project. 
		My website provides information about the style of the space composed of soft furnishings and I hope this information can be suitable for those who need help.</p>

	<h1>My Favorite Band: Block-B</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Block B is a South Korean boy band that debuted in 2011. 
		It consists of seven members: Taeil, B-Bomb, Jaehyo, U-Kwon, Park Kyung, Zico, and PO. Block B has received numerous honors, including seven Golden Disc Awards and eleven Seoul Music Award nominations.</p>

	<h2>Why I Like Them?</h2>
	<p>I first became interested in them after watching a drama starring one of their members in 2019. After listening to their songs, I really liked their songs and their style was very appealing to me. 
		My favorite member was ZICO, who is still releasing new songs and doing promotions. Unfortunately, the group hasn't had any group activities since 2021.</p>
